# Apollo Caching

This is the sample application for my presentation on Caching With Apollo Android at
[Apollo Day Mobile](https://twitter.com/apollographql/status/1349006587621482499) in 2021.

This application shows a list of countries on the main screen, and clicking on a country will load a
detail screen with more information. Using the caching tools from Apollo, this app is able to store
and load information as needed, saving on network requests and creating a better user experience
with fast load times.
